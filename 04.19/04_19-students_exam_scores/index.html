    <h1>Students Exam Scores</h1>

    <pre>
      In a class of 50 students who took an exam, one by one, take in the student's 
      name and his exam result (out of 100).  Create an array with all the names, 
      and another with all the results. 

      Output 1: Create one "string" list of all the names of those who passed with 
      a 70 or higher with a comma between each name. (Output outside the loop!).  
 
      Output 2:
      Give me the average of all those who passed calling one function,
 
      Output 3:
      And the average of those who failed calling another function.
