    <h1>Divisible By Five and Eight</h1>

    <pre>
      Type any number, get the numbers divisible in 5 from 1 to the number, put 
      them in an array, then the numbers divisible in 8 from 1 to the number, put 
      them in that same array.  Once you have them all, sum them up by calling a function.   
      Ex:  
      Input: 30   
      (5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30) + (8 + 16 + 24) = 153 
      array: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 8, 16, 24]
